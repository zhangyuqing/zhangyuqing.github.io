### Completed

#### Lung cancer classification from CT scan images using deep CNNs
*2017 Data Science Bowl Kaggle Competition*

+ Implemented U-Net with Python and Tensorflow according to literature for nodule segmentation
+ Developed deep convolutional neural networks for lung cancer classification
+ Applied batch normalization, drop-out layers, and tuned parameters to improve prediction accuracy
+ Augmented training data by random cropping and merging the training set with images from public databases of CT scans
+ Achieved performance comparable to top-50 out of nearly 2000 participating teams


#### A multivariate Gaussian Network model for detection of multiple perturbations in gene regulartory networks



#### Reference-batch ComBat: a linear model with empirical Bayes shrinkage for batch correction

Batch effect refers to non-biological variations in gene expression of samples generated under different conditions in microarray experiments. The existence of batch effect jeopardizes comparability of samples in different batches, causes difficulty in combining data from multiple batches for further analysis. Many methods have been used to adjust batch effect. ComBat uses empirical Bayes method on an L/S model that effectively adjusts the batch effect, and remains robust to outliers and small size batches. This project intends to develop a tool based on ComBat that deals with such an issue, when we want to reserve information from one specific batch, and let all the other batches resemble it. This batch is referred to as the “reference batch”.

#### Dataset heterogeneity in the validation of prediction models across studies

Previous study has shown decline in prediction accuracy of prognostic algorithms used across studies, which is regarded as an obstacle of implementing academically developed models in clinical use. We addressed three sources of heterogeneity between data sets than might account for the influence, including covariate shift, gene expression covariance and true simulation model. We designed methods to test each hypothesis.


#### Predicting Circadian Gene Expression in Neurospora crassa
*BU Bioinformatics Challenge Project*

+ Manipulated and exported RNA-Seq datasets in SQL databases
+ Designed a pipeline in MATLAB collaboratively, using discrete difference approximation and EM optimization, to predict regulatory effect in the circadian clock gene network


### Ongoing

#### ComBat-Seq: batch correction algorithm for RNA-Seq count data



#### Evaluating batch effect from a multi-study perspective

## Copy number variation study of child non-syndromic intellectual disability
With microarray sample of children with NSID, a type of mental retardation, we detected the genetic variants and focused on pathways under different levels of FDR control. We validated our result using published related genes to prove the efficiency of micro-array data in detecting CNVs, and summarized new findings. We also inspected hot spots in the samples, which could lead to potential clinical use.

## Microarray study: therapies impact on membranous glomerulonephritis
We used HMM-based CNVhac software to detect genes related to Chinese and Western therapies. Gene Ontology and Pathway Analysis were performed and the variant regions were visualized. To combine information of CNV and SNP, we used a lasso-logistic regression model as a classifier of genes.
