### ComBat-seq

### Reference-batch ComBat

Batch effect refers to non-biological variations in gene expression of samples generated under different conditions in microarray experiments. The existence of batch effect jeopardizes comparability of samples in different batches, causes difficulty in combining data from multiple batches for further analysis. Many methods have been used to adjust batch effect. ComBat uses empirical Bayes method on an L/S model that effectively adjusts the batch effect, and remains robust to outliers and small size batches. This project intends to develop a tool based on ComBat that deals with such an issue, when we want to reserve information from one specific batch, and let all the other batches resemble it. This batch is referred to as the “reference batch”.

### Dataset heterogeneity in the validation of prediction models across studies
Previous study has shown decline in prediction accuracy of prognostic algorithms used across studies, which is regarded as an obstacle of implementing academically developed models in clinical use. We addressed three sources of heterogeneity between data sets than might account for the influence, including covariate shift, gene expression covariance and true simulation model. We designed methods to test each hypothesis.

### A time-based model of altered circadian gene expression for Neurospora crassa.
The circadian clock is a major regulator of gene expression in many organisms, and is able to drive important metabolic functions in response to cyclical environmental factors. Neurospora crassa has long served as a model organism to study the circadian clock, given that a high proportion of its genes are under circadian control and that phenotypic changes in response to the clock are easily observed. While the effects of circadian-controlled gene expression have been widely explored, the mechanisms behind such processes are only beginning to be understood. A more thorough understanding of these underlying mechanisms is urgently motivated by the high prevalence of metabolic disease in adults, a phenomenon largely attributed to modern disruptions in human circadian rhythms. The goal of this project is to build a computational model of the N. crassa clock controlled regulatory network, which will be used to decipher mechanisms under the circadian regulatory network.

## Copy number variation study of child non-syndromic intellectual disability
With microarray sample of children with NSID, a type of mental retardation, we detected the genetic variants and focused on pathways under different levels of FDR control. We validated our result using published related genes to prove the efficiency of micro-array data in detecting CNVs, and summarized new findings. We also inspected hot spots in the samples, which could lead to potential clinical use.

## Microarray study: therapies impact on membranous glomerulonephritis
We used HMM-based CNVhac software to detect genes related to Chinese and Western therapies. Gene Ontology and Pathway Analysis were performed and the variant regions were visualized. To combine information of CNV and SNP, we used a lasso-logistic regression model as a classifier of genes.
