      <description>This is me in Hokkaido. Hello World!
  
My name, Yuqing (雨晴), is pronounced y-oo-ching. It means the sky clears up after rain.
I live mainly in Boston, but sometimes in Berkeley California too, where my husband, Ronghang, lives and works. We knew each other from high school, over 10 years ago.

      <description>Hardcore scientist with excellent communication skills, fast learner and critical thinker, dedicated, detail-oriented, analytical, and organized. I am passionate about using my expertise in statistical learning and programming to deliver game-changing knowledge from data.
I received B.S. in Applied Math from Peking University, after which I started graduate training at Boston University, working in Computational Biomedicine (CBM), while jointly advised by Evan and Giovanni. Now I am about to enter (hopefully) the final year of my PhD.</description>

      <description>Microarray and bulk RNA-seq data measure.
Background knowledge  Goal of this paper  Methods behind DESCEND  Results Model evaluation  Case studies Effect of cell size on differential non-zero mean and fraction analysis  DESCEND improves accuracy of cell type identification, by selecting better highly variable genes      Take-home messages  When all across-cell differences are accounted for, Poisson distribution is sufficient to capture technical noise in UMI-based scRNA-seq counts.</description>
