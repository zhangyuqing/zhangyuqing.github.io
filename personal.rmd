My name, Yuqing (雨晴), is pronounced *y-oo-ching*. It means the sky clears up after rain. 

You've come to my place to write down the things I learn, fun projects I work on, events of my life and random thoughts. The title of my website, *Stars and Sea (星辰大海)*, is quoted from Yuandong Tian, an accomplished research scientist in deep learning. In this [summary](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/45703402) of his PhD life , he said: 

> 要习惯于两线作战，要有“进可攻”的长期课题，也要有“退可守”的短期课题，这样既减少对短期绩效评估的担心，又怀抱有长远的希望。然而要做到这一点，是需要大量的技术和细节支撑，一点一点地从严苛的现实世界中，从每天24小时里面，取回自己想要的东西。在理完纷乱的俗务之后，还能心向茫茫的星辰大海。

A rough translation is that it is critical to keep in mind both the short-term and long-term goals, and do not lose yourself in the trivial, day-to-day grind, but forget the "stars and sea", or your ultimate pursuit. 

So more about me... I live mainly in Boston, but sometimes in Berkeley California too, where my husband, [Ronghang](http://ronghanghu.com), lives and works. We knew each other from high school, over 10 years ago.

I spend most of my time on research and study. But whenever possible, I would gather and chat with my friends, or have a nice beer while watching a good movie. My lifelong favourite movie is [Cracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracks_(film)). I'm a fun of J-pops, for example, [*Akane Sasu* by Aimer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUC6vqC1kw); and popular Chinese ballads, some examples include [*An He Qiao* by Dongye Song (安和桥-宋冬野) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DNek3U0W2Q) and [*Wu Wen* by Mao Buyi (无问-毛不易)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCYqEeIW4WY&list=RDZCYqEeIW4WY&start_radio=1). I also love to keep a healthy lifestyle (except for the beer-drinking, of course). I get up around 7am regularly, keep track of everything I eat, and walk to anywhere within walking distance as long as the weather allows, which sadly is often not the case in New England winters.  

If I were to summarize my view of the world in one sentence, it would be that *our abilities, hard-work and sense of duties determine the lower bound of our achievements, while passion and enthusiasm determine the upper*. I value genuine enthusiasm in people. I don't have a specific role model, but I tend to look up to curious, highly energetic people, who would give all they have to achieve something they truly enjoy. I hope to live my life as one of them.
